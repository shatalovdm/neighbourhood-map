# Neighborhood Map

This web app helps user find restaurants by zip code. User can filter results by name, address, and price and reserve a table by following a link to OpenTable website.

There are two APIs used in this project: [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and an unofficial [OpenTable API](https://github.com/sosedoff/opentable). Restaurant data is provided by OpenTable. Search and filter functionality is implemented by using Knockout.js library.
